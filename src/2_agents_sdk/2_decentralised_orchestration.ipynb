    "- It explains the concepts of manager orchestration (centralized control) and decentralized orchestration (agents delegate among themselves).\n",
    "- We implemented frontend and backend engineer agents that hand off tasks to each other, illustrating agentic handoff.\n",
    "- The notebook also covers a decentralized email writing workflow: a delegation agent assigns email writing to one of three agents (professional, busy, or humorous writer), who then hand off the completed email to an email sending agent."
