## My Company: ByteMage

At ByteMage, I lead a team that provides **full-cycle software development** — from web and mobile applications to
**AI-driven products**.

- **Brand & Voice**: ByteMage represents a professional, innovative, and slightly bold brand identity.
  I take inspiration from companies like 10Pearls for how we communicate.
- **Clients I Work With**:
  1. Non-technical founders who have ideas but no product development experience.
  2. Technical founders who want to launch or scale a product.
  3. Enterprises seeking process optimization or AI adoption.
- **Clients & Success Stories**:
  - AskHumans (whose clients include Hard Rock Café and the World Bank).
  - Jackson Fire & Safety, ESO Ventures, Telenor, and Nord A1.
- **Industries**: Rather than restricting ByteMage to specific industries, I focus on the **types of problems clients face** and tailor solutions accordingly.

## Professional Focus Areas

### 1. AI & Agent Development

I build **practical AI agents** designed to solve real-world problems, including:

- **Lead enrichment and scoring agents** that analyze company data, websites, and LinkedIn profiles.
- **Requirement-gathering agents** that act like business analysts, asking clarifying questions and generating structured requirement outputs.
- **Lead scoring frameworks** that measure both how desirable a lead is and how likely I am to win them.

### 2. Education & Training

I design and deliver **AI education programs** for experienced engineers:

- A **curriculum for Python developers** to learn AI agent development from scratch.
- An **instructor-led program** for engineers with Python/JavaScript backgrounds, covering:
  - LLM integration basics.
  - Building agents from scratch.
  - Frameworks & orchestration tools.
  - Multi-modal agents, memory, and tool use.
  - Deployment and API billing management.
- The learning model is **hands-on, project-based, with peer reviews and a final team project**.

### 3. Software Agency Operations

I work closely with founders and enterprises to scope, plan, and deliver technology solutions.  
A big part of my role is **navigating early-stage conversations with non-technical clients**, especially around the **costing challenge** — helping them understand why detailed requirements are essential before committing to estimates.

## Creative & Side Projects

- I am producing a **3D short film in Blender** (90–120 seconds) that visualizes the internals of a MacBook, traveling through components like CPU, GPU, RAM, and SSD.
- I am refining my **personal branding** on LinkedIn to position myself as a thought leader around how **AI is reshaping business operations**.
- I initiated **Magents (Mage + Agents)**, an internal ByteMage learning channel where my team and I explore and build AI agents together.

Murtaza Khan’s journey combines **technical depth, entrepreneurial leadership, and a drive to teach**.  
I am not just building products for today but also shaping the way **AI-powered systems and agents** will support businesses in the years to come.
